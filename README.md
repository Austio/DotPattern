DotPattern
==========

All code necessary to determine possible dot patterns from my blog post at http://www.austinstory.com/pattern-lock-passwords-not-as-many-choices-as-you-would-think/

Just copy the code into your ruby folder.  

Pattern.work(x)
  Determines the dot patterns possible from 2..x.  So would if x is 6, it would spit out 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
  
Pattern.determine_routes(x)
  Determines the results from a single dot pattern.
